# project-2-group-1
Web Scraping &amp; APIs
<!-- purpose of the program --> This project involves implementing a Python program that scrapes roster data for CUNY athletic teams (men’s swimming, men’s volleyball, women’s swimming, women’s volleyball), processes player height information, and stores it in both CSV and SQLite database formats. The program calculates average heights, identifies the tallest and shortest players, and outputs findings for analysis.

<!-- how to run the program --> 

#Step 1: 
- Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/CIS-3120-SUMMER-2025/project-2-group-1.git

#Step 2: 
- Run the program: 
  python3 main.py

#Step 3:
The program will: 
Scrape a Billboard chart table and store it in a CSV file; use song titles or artist names to query an API and collect additional information; store the API data in a separate dataframe; merge the two dataframes into a combined dataset and export it to CSV. Additionally, the program will scrape data from each team’s roster web page, save the data into individual CSV files, a merged CSV, and an SQLite database file, and output average heights along with the tallest and shortest players by sport.

<!-- each member's contributions -->
Loverta Brown: Generated the folders and webscrapingpy files for each question, did the scraping for the billboard and did DF1, did questions 3, 4, 6, and 9 in Question 2.
Nicole Ng: Did DF3, merged and printed data, and imported it into a SQL database. Did questions 2 and 7 in Question 2, as well as debugging the errors in the code for all question parts of Question 2, then merged it all into one single coding file.
Paramjot Singh: Did DF2 with api integration and made the api request per record. Did questions 1, 5, and 8 of Question 2, as well as debugging any errors.
